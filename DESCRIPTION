Description: Scalable multiple imputation using denoising and variational
    autoencoders with dropout. It uses R package `torch` as the backend, which
    is based on `PyTorch`. It supports different types of variables and `GPU` 
    acceleration is available. Users can also save an imputation model to
    impute new data.
