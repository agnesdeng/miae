### Changes 
- `data_clean()` now becomes `check_data()`. This function performs preliminary sanity check before imputation. A few checks have been added. 
- Some arguments' names have changed in `show_var()` function for compatibility with **vismi** package. 
- The dataset `nhanes3_newborn` has been replaced with `newborn`, with variables renamed for clarity and to align with the **vismi** package.
- Variable names in `nhanes3` have been updated to maintain consistency with `newborn`.
