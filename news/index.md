# Changelog

## miae 0.0.1

#### Changes

- [`data_clean()`](../reference/data_clean.md) now becomes
  `check_data()`. This function performs preliminary sanity check before
  imputation. A few checks have been added.
- Some arguments’ names have changed in `show_var()` function for
  compatibility with **vismi** package.
- The dataset `nhanes3_newborn` has been replaced with `newborn`, with
  variables renamed for clarity and to align with the **vismi** package.
- Variable names in `nhanes3` have been updated to maintain consistency
  with `newborn`.
